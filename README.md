# SHEF Test Tool
### Test tool to help tests on DirectvÂ´s boxes
This is a linux application to help people to control some directv boxes using jsonRPC.

I had created it when I worked for Censanet (a Company contracted by Directv to test the boxes's firmwares).
Obviously I removed some important data, like the json URL and the serial commands.

It is useful for tests because you can control manualy the box or create a script file to cover some default tests and replicate a problem.
